                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    Pentathlon is a sport contest consisting of 5 events, and one of the oldest games part 
                    of the Ancient Olympics. The first ever documented Pentathlon was in 708 BC in Ancient Greece.
                    In mythology, it is said that Jason is the creator of the Pentathlon and naming his frined Pelus as the first ever winner.
                    Pentathlon has made it over countless centuries and is still prelevant till this day in the Olympics, even having variations of it. Due to the numerous amount of skills needed,
                    pentathletes were seen and held to a high standard as prime physical specimens. By the 77th Olympics, the events were usually done in a trio of events, followed up by 2 individual events explained later on.

                <h2>Rules</h2>
                <p>
                    In the Ancient Pentathlon, the format varied depending on the shedule and events.

                <h3>Long Jump</h3>
                <p>
                    Competitors run down a runway/path as their initial approach and attempt to jummp 
                    and leap as far away from where they first jumped. Each competitor has 3 tries.
                </p>

                <h3>Javelin Throwing</h3>
                <p>
                    Within a preset area, competitors do an inital short run, gaining momentum and throw a spear of about 8 ft 2 in in length as far as they possibly can.
                </p>

                <h3>Discus Throwing</h3>
                <p>
                    Also known as disc throw, competitors throw a heavy disk weighing on average 2 kg, attempting to mark a farther distance than others.
