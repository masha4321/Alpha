                <h2>History</h2>      
                <p> 
                    The <i>dolichos</i> was an ancient Greek race introduced in 720BC and
                    held at three of the four Panhellenic festivals, the ancient Olympic Games, Pythian Games and Nemean Games.  
                    It's a 4800m long race and the event is similar to the modern "marathon". It was the longest race among Greek athletic
                    festivals. <br><br> According to the philosopher Philostratus, the dolichos was not as intense as we can imagine: the speed
                    was only a little faster than walking speed. It served more as background entertainment for the spectators. 
                     <br><br>
                     The prestige of winning 
                     the race was much more significant than the prize he received, which was an olive branch.
                     <br><br>
                    The dolichos is believed to have originated from the distances covered by the messengers that delivered news and messages throughout Greece.
                    <br><br>
                    The sport was abolished in 394AD.
