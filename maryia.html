                <h2>History</h2>      
                <p> 
                    The dolichos was an ancient Greek race introduced in 720BC and
                    held at three of the four Panhellenic festivals, the ancient Olympic Games, Pythian Games and Nemean Games.  
                    It's a 4800m long race and the event is similar to the modern "marathon". It was the longest race among Greek athletic
                    festivals. According to the philosopher Philostratus, the dolichos was not as intense as we can imagine: the speed
                    was only little faster than walking speed. It served more as a background entertainement for the spectators. 
                    The sport was abolished in 394AD.

                <div><h2>Rules</h2>      
                <p>The race took place on a track called stadiion, located in the stadium. 
                    The athletes would line up at the beggining of the track, nude,barefoot and waiting for the judge's  take off signal.
                    The first runner to complete the laps won the title.
