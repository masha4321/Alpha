                    <p>Pankration is one of the oldest mixed martial on record. You can derive this martial art all the 
                    way back to ancient Greece, during the second millenium BCE. Pankration is a mix of
                    boxing and wrestling, and full contact. We see it as a sport; however, back then it was also a fighting system
                    that the armies used as part of their arsenal.It was widely used from the mighty Spartans to 
                    the great Macedonian Phalanxes. They introduced the martial art during the 33rd
                    Olympic Games and very quickly became a crowd favourite.

                    <h2>Rules</h2><img class="pic" alt="grappling opponent" src="Pankration2.jpg">
                    <p>A full contact sport that allows the participants to use different techniques such as striking,
                        grappling, and wrestling. This sport virtually had no rules, almost anything was allowed during 
                        a fight. The match ends when someone is under submission by raising their index finger or by death.
                        There are two phases, <em>Ano Pankration</em> (Upper Pankration), this is where they would fight upright
                        and try to bring the opponent to the ground. Once on the ground, they are now in the second phase, 
                        <em>Kato Pankration</em> (Lower Pankration), this is where they are able to do any form of grappling and 
                        wrestling. At this point they will try to put the opponent into a submission to win the game.

                    <h2>Fun Facts</h2><img class="pic" alt="modern pankration" src="Pankration3.jpg">
                    <p>Greek Mythology depicts Thesus using pankration to defeat the minotaur in the Labyrinth 
                        of Minos.
                        
                         Pankration is still played during modern time as a sport in both Olymics and
                         as a recreational activity. 
                         
                         The word pankration is derived from acient Greek word 
                         <em>Pan</em> for all and the word <em>Kratos</em> for might, all together meaning
                         "all of the might". 
                    
                         When the sport was initally developed, the participants fought in 
                         the nude and were oiled up. Eventually they started to wearing wrappings around their
                         hands and forearms.
