                <p>Pankration is one of the oldest mixed martial on record. You can derive this martial art all the 
                    way back to ancient Greece, during the second millenium BCE. Pankration is a mix of
                    boxing and wresstling, and full contact. We see it as a sport; however, back then it was also a fighting system
                    that the armies used as part of their arsenal. They introduced the martial art during the 33rd
                    Olympic Games and very quickly became a crowd favourite.
